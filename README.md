## Problem of previous project

### Only for review, not for regular use

**https://github.com/helixd2s/Alter-Died/tree/main**

- Unluck and bloat architecture
- Building a new one on top of the old one
- Abuse of the "do what you want" policy
- Unsuitable for debugging
- Unreasonable code bloat
- It's all very confusing
- Undivided roles
- Headaches
