# Planned project

### Important Notice. Until I find and assemble a proper team of developers (at least 5 people), I will never in my life take on such projects, of this kind and nature. Simplify anything here already impossible. I'm fed up with it all and I'm not able anymore, problem after problem, one worse and more complicated than another. I am no longer able to solve everything alone.

## Problem of previous project

### Only for review, not for regular use

**https://github.com/helixd2s/Alter-Died/tree/main**

- Unluck and bloat architecture
- Building a new one on top of the old one
- Abuse of the "do what you want" policy
- Unsuitable for debugging
- Unreasonable code bloat
- It's all very confusing
- Undivided roles
- Headaches
